## Getting Started

Before you can get started, get the libraries we need:

```
npm install
```

Now, your task is to complete several Javascript files on the way to mastering checksums. Each task has an associated set of tests so that you can tell when you've completed the task properly. You should read the test files for each one before you get started to better understand the task -- although each is described in it's associated exercise description file (found in this directory).

You can run the tests using the following command:

```
npm test
```

If you do that before writing any code you should see that many tests are failing.

## Writing Code and Skipping Ahead

Once you're able to run the tests, it's time to start coding. Depending on what you want to practice you may want to skip some of the sections. For example, maybe you're already well practiced in generating and manipulating random string data. If you'd like to skip ahead, simply replace the contents of the file you want to skip with it's counterpart in `/src/solutions`. Similarly, if you get stuck but don't want to punt wholesale, you can look at the solution files for inspiration.

Now go ahead and read the other files in this directory and decide what you want to work on!
